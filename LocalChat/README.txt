The project is designed for TPO classes. It consists of a GUI for chat users to communicate.
Before compilation, we need to start the server. My choice was OpenJMS-0.7.7 (remember to set up paths in JMS).
An example command to start it on Windows in an admin CMD is: bin\openjms.bat run.
I recommend using "Run in parallel" option that enables to create many users for testing if you are using IntelliJ.
